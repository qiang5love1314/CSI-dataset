# CSI-dataset

Here are the channel state information (CSI) dataset which could be utilized for indoor localization. We collect them in two real world environments:
Area One: It is a 13.5×11m2 computer laboratory with tables, chairs and obstacles, which can be considered as a NLOS scenario. And there are 317 sampling locations.
Area Two: It is a 7×10m2 meeting room and almost empty, which can be considered as a LOS scenario. And there are 176 sampling locations.
